Experience brutal knockouts with this immersive unconsciousness system! When your health drops below 20, you'll collapse with a realistic bodyfall thud, your vision blurs, and you ragdoll to the ground. Watch through your ragdoll's eyes as everything fades to black, then slowly regain consciousness after 30 seconds.

Features:
✓ Instant knockout with custom bodyfall sound
✓ Realistic ragdoll physics with momentum preservation
✓ First-person ragdoll view
✓ Blur effects and timed fade in/out
✓ Automatic revival with safe spawn positioning
✓ Damage redirection while unconscious
✓ Inspired by DayZ
✓ You can be killed while uncon
✓ You can force uncon (uncon_force <player_name>)
✓ !faint for roleplay things (with gasp sound)
✓ Cooldown so you can't go uncon every 3 seconds
✓ Console command uncon_sethp <1-1000>

Perfect for DayZ-style servers, survival gamemodes, or any server wanting more immersive combat consequences!
